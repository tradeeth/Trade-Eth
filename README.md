Trade ETH is a decentralized Ethereum Token Exchange with the most ERC20 listings of any exchange.


# What is Trade ETH?
Trade ETH currently acts as an open source, updated interface for EtherDelta's smart contract with an active and public development team. Although ForkDelta started as a fork of EtherDelta, considerable development time has been put towards a new token listing system, API, and all of which are at different stages of development and can be tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/TradeETH/). 

# TETH token
TETH token is a dividend token which pays dividends from the distribution of the reward from exchange earnings to its shareholders.

TETH is used to pay for transaction fees on TradeETH. Each transaction costs a fixed fee depending on the account level (regular, silver or gold user).

Owner calls `disburse` function pay dividends to the contract and token holders automatically get their part of TETH dividends on their next TETH trade or when `updateDividend` function is called.

# How does Trade ETH Work?
Trade ETH currently interfaces with EtherDelta's original smart contract (described in more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherDelta/comments/6kdiyl/smart_contract_overview/)) which allows Trade ETH users to trade utilizing EtherDelta's volume.

# Contribute
We welcome contributions from the community. You can contribute by improving the code, documentation, or by donating. 
Trade ETH currently interfaces with EtherDelta's original smart contract which allows ForkDelta users to trade utilizing EtherDelta's volume. However, this means that the trading fees still go to EtherDelta and Trade ETH development costs come entirely out of our pockets. If you are interested in the Trade ETH project and would like to contribute to its future, please consider donating to the following Ethereum address: <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xaE36d387fD7b8B3379E1f4f6AF8216603Ec9b000">0xaE36d387fD7b8B3379E1f4f6AF8216603Ec9b000</a>

As this is a project by the community, for the community, transactions to and from the donations address will be public and can be viewed on the blockchain. We will also keep a public ledger of how the donations are distributed. That way, donors can see exactly how their donations are helping!
